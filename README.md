# Kilroy

Your memories. At the places they happened.

## What is Kilroy?

Kilroy surfaces your own photos when you return to the places you took them. No social network. No sharing. Just you and your memories, rising from the ground.

## How it works

1. Grant location and photos permissions
2. Kilroy indexes your geotagged photos
3. Live your life
4. When you walk past a place where you took a photo, Kilroy taps you
5. Look at your phone and see what you captured there — maybe years ago

## Technical

- SwiftUI + iOS 17+
- CoreLocation for location tracking
- Photos framework for spatial indexing
- CoreHaptics for tactile feedback
- 100% on-device — your photos never leave your phone

## Building

```bash
cd Kilroy
xcodegen generate
open Kilroy.xcodeproj
```
